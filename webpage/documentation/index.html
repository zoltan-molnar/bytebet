                    <h2>Intorduction</h2>
                    <p> Trumpet is a clean, responsive, neatly designed premium HTML template, built by
                        with developers in mind. It was built with the purpose of expediting
                        the build process of a new website, and a lot of thought had been put into the
                        structure of each section of the website.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="getting-started" class="content-section">
                    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                    <h3>Local Deployment</h3>
                    <h4>Requirements</h4>
                    <p>The best way to deploy Trumpet is to build it on a local machine first,
                        and then copy the neccessary files over to a server. In order to do that
                        you will need Node and NPM installed on your computer. You can check
                        to see if it is installed by typing in your console:</p>
                        <pre><code>npm -v
5.3.0</code></pre>
                <p>
                    If you do not get a version number it means you do not have NPM installed. You
                    can follow the installation instructions <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">here</a>.
                </p>
                    <p>You will also need to have Webpack installed on your computer <strong>globally</strong>.
                        Once you have npm installed, you can install webpack by typing in in your console:
                    </p>
                <pre><code>npm install -g webpack</code></pre>
                    <h4>Installation</h4>
                    <p>When you complete your purchase you are prompted to download a <code>trumpet.zip</code>
                        file. Unzip it and move the folder to your preffered loaction. Open your
                        console and navigate to the directory of the template like so:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>cd path/to/trumpet</code></pre>
                    <p>Install the npm packages by typing the next command:</p>
                    <pre><code>npm install</code></pre>
                    <p>Once the packages have finished installing you will need to compile the JS and SCSS files.
                        You can easily do this by typing:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>webpack</code></pre>
                    <p>You will be able to see that two new files have been added to the <code>public</code>
                        directory: <code>bundle.js</code> and <code>styles.min.css</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>In order to view the website simply open on the file <code>trumpet/public/index.html</code> to open it in your
                        favorite browser.
                    </p>

                <div id="editing" class="content-section">
                    <h2>Editing</h2>
                    <h3>Sass</h3>
                    <p>Trumpet was built in order to house different types of content. In order to
                    maintain the tempalte maticulous design, make sure that you copy the classes of
                    each element you subtitute. There may be some cases where you will need to tweak
                        the css of the website. Trumpet uses Sass to preprocess the css files of the website.
                        If you are unfamiliar with Sass, you can find more about it <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.
                        In order for the browser to read the new styles the SCSS files need to be compiled into
                        regular CSS. You can easily achieve this by navigating in your console to the directory of
                        Trumpet and typing:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>webpack --watch</code></pre>
                    <p>Leave your console open and continue editing the SCSS files. Webpack will automatically recompile
                    the files whenever you make a change.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Projects Section</h3>
                    <p>
                        The projects section was built with the use of a plugin called <a href="https://isotope.metafizzy.co/" target="_blank">Isotope.</a>
                        Each button has a property called "data-filter" that sets the class this button will present.
                        You can find out more in the isotope website.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Testimonials Section</h3>
                    <p>
                        The projects section was built with the use of a plugin called <a href="http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/" target="_blank">Slick.</a>
                        When adding more testimonials, make sure to copy the classes exactly for the plugin to work.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Setting Up Email</h3>
                    <p>
                        In order for the form to send you emails from visitors on the website, the site must be deployed
                        to a PHP server. Before you deploy the website make sure to enter your email in the file
                        <code>public/mail/index.php</code> at the top of the file like so:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>//Enter your email â†“
$to = 'youremail@gmail.com';</code></pre>
                    <h3>Setting up the Map</h3>
                    <p>
                        In order to set up the map in the template you need to do two things:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Enter your API key which you get from google by following <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key" target="_blank">these instructions</a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Adding the longtitude and latitude values of the address you want shown on the map.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>API Key</h4>
                    <p> Once you have the API key, go to <code>pubic/index.html</code> and scroll all the way to the bottom of the page.
                        Find the link to the Google Maps script and enter your API key like so:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
                    <h4>Map Address</h4>
                    <p>
                        In order to get the longtitude and latitude values of your address you can use various online generators like
                        <a href="http://www.latlong.net/" target="_blank">this one</a>.
                        After you have the values go to <code>js/script.js</code>. At the top of the file you will find
                        a place to enter your values: <code>lat</code> for latitude and <code>lng</code> for longtitude like so:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>var office = {lat: 40.748541, lng: -73.985758};</code></pre>
                </div>
                <div id="deployment" class="content-section">
                    <h2>Deployment</h2>
                    <p>Deployment of Trumpet is extremely easy. Once you have built the website locally, set your details, and
                    edited the content to your liking, simply copy the <code>public</code> directory's contents to your website's
                    folder on your hosting service via FTP.</p>
